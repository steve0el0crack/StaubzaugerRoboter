# StaubzaugerRoboter

THE PROBLEM
Having a world that can be represented as following: 

[ - - 
  - - ]

And setting a robot (StaubzaugerRoboter) in a random position:

[ - -
  x - ]
  
How can the robot go through each of the places and "remove" the trash he finds, leaving at the end everything clean.

For resolving this problem come to our minds not only one way, but many others and very different each one from another.
We try to explain those which were implemented during the search of the very optimized one.

FIRST IMPLEMENTATION
setting world...
[{':state': ''}, {':state': ''}]
[{':state': ''}, {':state': ''}]

adding roboter(":origin")...
[{':origin': 1, ':state': 0}, {':state': 0}]
[{':state': 0}, {':state': 0}]
